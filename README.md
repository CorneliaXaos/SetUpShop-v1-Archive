# SetUpShop-v1-Archive

This repo is an archive of an installation "script" that has become the basis for a more ambitious project I'm calling "Set Up Shop".  This particular archive is SERIOUSLY OUTDATED and should probably not be used under any circumstances.  It's here purely for the sake of immortalizing it on the internet.

For a more recent, up-to-date script that is also easily customizable for your needs, please check out the SetUpShop-v2-Archive.  (Link pending.)
