# SetUpShop-v1-Archive

This repo is an archive of an installation "script" that has become the basis for a more ambitious project I'm calling "Set Up Shop".  This particular archive is SERIOUSLY OUTDATED and should probably not be used under any circumstances.  It's here purely for the sake of immortalizing it on the internet.

For a more recent, up-to-date script that is also easily customizable for your needs, please check out the [SetUpShop-v2-Archive.][1]

NOTE: This installation script was originally designed for an old version of UBUNTU (something like 16.04).  As such it probably won't work on other distros or even an up-to-date version of Ubuntu itself.
